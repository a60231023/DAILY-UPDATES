day 11

task 5 & 6 was finished commited it.

task 7 was with sahil bhaiya.
working on the zohoCRM integration part.
first, I changed the placeholder name for the different entity like tenants, contract, lead and property.what kind of data will be seen coming from backend so changed according to that.

The next thing was to add errorlogs so on the intergaration dashboard, added a button on the zohocrm card, clicking on it will take to a route /errorlogs so made a html and controoler file for that. In ths html file the data will be coming from the different service provider according to the entity so I have to show that on that page in a table view. will continue on the same task.
